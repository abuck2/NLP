Introduction.

[Transcriber's Note: This e-book is Number 4 of Volume X of a series, which
had a single page numbering system throughout the Volume. Thus, although this
e-book is pages 233 through 351, it contains references to pages outside of this
range in the same Volume.]


With the publication of the texts included in this the last
part of volume X, Sumerian Liturgical and Epical Texts, the
writer arrives at a definite stage in the interpretation of the
religious material in the Nippur collection. Having been privileged
to examine the collection in Philadelphia as well as that
in Constantinople, I write with a sense of responsibility in
giving to the public a brief statement concerning what the
temple library of ancient Nippur really contained. Omitting the
branches pertaining to history, law, grammar and mathematics,
the following rÃ©sumÃ© is limited to those tablets which, because
of their bearing upon the history of religion, especially upon
the origins of Hebrew religion, have attracted the attention of
the public on two continents to the collections of the University
Museum.


Undoubtedly the group of texts which have the most human
interest and greatest literary value is the epical group, designated
in Sumerian by the rubric zag-sal.1 This literary term
was employed by the Sumerian scribes to designate a composition
as didactic and theological. Religious texts of such
kind are generally composed in an easy and graceful style
and, although somewhat influenced by liturgical mannerisms,
may be readily distinguished from the hymns and psalms
sung in the temples to musical accompaniment. The zagsal
[pg 234]
compositions2 are mythological and theological treatises concerning
the deeds and characters of the great gods. The most
important didactic hymns of the Nippur collection and in fact
the most important religious texts in early Sumerian literature
are two six column tablets, one (very incomplete) on the Creation
and the Flood published by Dr. Poebel, and one (all but
complete) on Paradise and the Fall of Man. Next in importance is
a large six column tablet containing a mythological and didactic
hymn on the characteristics of the virgin mother
goddess.3
A long mythological hymn in four columns4
on the cohabitation
of the earth god Enlil and the mother goddess Ninlil and an
equally long but more literary hymn to the virgin goddess
Innini5 are good examples of this group of
tablets in the Nippur
collection.6
One of the most interesting examples of didactic
composition is a hymn to the deified king Dungi of Ur. By
accident both the Philadelphia and the Constantinople collections
possess copies of this remarkable poem and the entire
text has been reconstructed by the writer in a
previous publication.7
1 have already signaled the unique importance of this
extraordinary hymn to the god-man Dungi in which he is
described as the divinely born king who was sent by the gods
[pg 235]
to restore the lost paradise.8
The poem mentions the flood
which, according to the Epic of Paradise, terminated by divine
punishment the Utopian age. The same mythological belief
underlies the hymn to Dungi. Paradise had been lost and this
god-man was sent to restore the golden age. There is a direct
connection between this messianic hymn to Dungi and the
remarkable Epic of Paradise. All other known hymns to deified
kings are liturgical compositions and have the rubrics which
characterize them as songs sung in public services. But the
didactic hymn to Dungi has the rubric
[dDungi]
zag-sal, âO
praise Dungi.â It would be difficult to claim more conclusive
evidence than this for the correctness of our interpretation of
the group of zagsal literature and of the entire mythological
and theological exegesis propounded in the edition of the Epic
of Paradise, edited in part one of this volume.9


When our studies shall have reached the stage which renders
appropriate the collection of these texts into a special corpus
they will receive their due valuation in the history of religion.
That they are of prime importance is universally accepted.


From the point of view of the history of religion I would
assign the liturgical texts to the second group in order of importance.
Surprisingly few fragments from the long canonical
daily prayer services have been found. In fact, about all of the
perfected liturgies such as we know the Sumerian temples to
have possessed belong to the cults of deified kings. In the
[pg 236]
entire religious literature of Nippur, not one approximately
complete canonical prayer service has survived. Only fragments
bear witness to their existence in the public song services
of the great temples in Nippur. A small tablet10 published in
part two of this volume carries a few lines of the titular or
theological litany of a canonical or musically completed prayer
book as they finally emerged from the liturgical schools throughout
Sumer. Long liturgical services were evolved in the temples
at Nippur as we know from a few fragments of large five column
tablets.11 The completed composite liturgies or canonical
breviaries as they finally received form throughout Sumer in
the Isin period were made by selecting old songs of lament and
praise and re-editing them so as to develop theological ideas.
Characteristic of these final song services is the titular litany as
the penultimate song and a final song as an intercession. A
considerable number of such perfected services exist in the
Berlin collection. These were obtained apparently from Sippar.12
The writer has made special efforts to reconstruct the Sumerian
canonical series as they existed in the age of Isin and the first
Babylonian dynasty. On the basis of tablets not excavated
at Nippur but belonging partly to the University Museum and
partly to the Berlin collection the writer restored the greater
part of an Enlil liturgy in part 2, pp. 155-167.13 In the present
and final part of this volume another Enlil liturgy has been
largely reconstructed on pages 290-306.14 From these two
partially reconstructed song services the reader will obtain an
[pg 237]
approximate idea of the elaborate liturgical worship of the
late Sumerian period. These were adopted by the Babylonians
and Assyrians as canonical and were employed in interlinear
editions by these Semitic peoples. Naturally the liturgical
remains of the Babylonian and Assyrian breviaries are much
more numerous and on the basis of these the writer was able in
previous volumes to identify and reconstruct a large number of
the Sumerian canonical musical services. But a large measure
of success has not yet attended his efforts to reconstruct the
original unilingual liturgies commonly written on one huge
tablet of ten columns. Obviously the priestly schools of the
great religious center at Nippur possessed these perfected prayer
books but their great size was fatal to their preservation. It
must be admitted that the Nippur collection has contributed
almost nothing from the great canonical Sumerian liturgies
which surely existed there.


Much better is the state of preservation of the precanonical
liturgies, or long song services constructed by simply joining a
series of kiÅ¡ubs or songs of prostration.
These kiÅ¡ub liturgies
are the basis of the more intricate canonical liturgies and in
this aspect the Nippur collection surpasses in value all others.
Canonical and perfected breviaries may be termed liturgical
compositions and the precanonical breviaries may be described
as liturgical compilations, if we employ âcompositionâ and
âcompilationâ in their exact Latin sense. Since Sumerian
song services of the earlier type, that is liturgical compilations,
are more extensively represented in the Nippur temple library
than in any other, this is an appropriate place to give an exact
description of this form of prayer service which preceded and prepared
the way to the greatest system of musical ritual in any
ancient religion. If we may judge from the literary remains of
[pg 238]
Nippur now in the University Museum, the priestly schools of
temple music in that famous city were extremely conservative
about abandoning the ancient liturgical compilations. These daily
song services, all of sorrowful sentiment and invariably emphasizing
humility and human suffering, are constructed by simply
compiling into one breviary a number of ancient songs, selected in
such manner that all are addressed to one deity. In this manner
arose intricate choral compilations of length suitable to a daily
prayer, each addressed to a great god. Hence we have in the
temple libraries throughout Sumer and Babylonia liturgies to each
of the great gods. Even in the less elaborate kiÅ¡ub compilations
there is in many cases revealed a tendency to recast and arrange
the collection of songs upon deeper principles. A tendency to
include in all services a song to the wrathful word of the gods
and a song to the sorrowful earth mother is seen even in the
Nippurian breviaries of the precanonical type. I need not dilate
here upon the great influence which these principles exercised
upon the beliefs and formal worship of Assyria and Babylonia,
upon the late Jewish Church and upon Christianity. The
personified word of god and the worship of the great
mater
dolorosa, or the virgin goddess, are ancient Sumerian creations
whose influence has been effective in all lands.


As examples of the liturgical compilation texts the reader
is referred especially to the following tablets. On pages 290-292
the writer has described the important compiled liturgy found by
Charles Virolleaud.15 It is an excellent example of a Nippurian
musical prayer service. It contained eleven kiÅ¡ubs, or prayers,
and they are recast in such manner that the whole set forth one
idea which progresses to the end. The liturgy has in fact almost
reached the stage of a composition. And in these same pages
[pg 239]
the reader will see how this service finally resulted in a canonical
liturgy, for the completed product has been recovered. On
pages 309-310 will be found a fragment, part of an ancient
liturgy to Enlil of the compiled type. Here again we are able
to produce at least half of the great liturgy into which the old
service issued. In the preceding part of this volume, pages
184-187, is given the first song of a similar liturgy addressed to
the mother goddess.


Undoubtedly the most important liturgical tablet which
pertains to the ordinary cults in the Nippur collection is discussed
on pages 279-285. The breviary, which probably
belongs to the cult of the moon-god, derives importance from
its great length, its theological ideas, especially the mention of
the messengers which attend the Logos or Word of Enlil, and
its musical principles. Here each song has an antiphon which
is unusual in precanonical prayer books of the ordinary cults.16
Students of the history of liturgies will be also particularly
interested in the unique breviary compiled from eight songs of
prostration, a lamentation for the ancient city of KeÅ¡ with theological
references. This song service was popular at Nippur, for
remains of at least two copies have been found in the collection.
A translation is given on pages 311-323.


The oldest public prayer services consisted of only one
psalm or song. A good number of these ancient psalms are
known from other collections, especially from those of the British
Museum. In view of the conservative attitude of the liturgists
at Nippur it is indeed surprising that so few of the old temple
songs have survived as they were originally employed; ancient
single song liturgies in this collection are rare. The following
[pg 240]
list contains all the notable psalms of this kind. Radau,
Miscellaneous Sumerian Texts No. 317 is a lamentation of the
mother goddess and her appeal to Enlil on behalf of various
cities which had been visited by wars and other afflictions.
Radau, ibid., No. 16 has the rubric
ki-Å¡u18 sÃ¬r-gal dEnlil,
âA prayer
of prostration, a great song unto Enlil.â A psalm of the weeping
mother goddess similar in construction to Radau No. 3 is edited
on pages 260-264 of this volume.19 No. 7 of this part, edited on
pages 276-279, is an excellent illustration of the methods
employed in developing the old single song psalms into compiled liturgies.
Here we have a short song service to the moon god constructed
by putting together two ancient psalms. The rubrics designate
them as sagar
melodies,20 or choral songs, and adds that it is
sung to the lyre.21 An especially fine psalm of a liturgical
character was translated on pages 115-117. It is likewise a lament
to the sorrowful mother goddess.


The student of Sumero-Babylonian religion will not fail to
comment upon one remarkable lacuna in the religious literature
of every Sumerian city which has been excavated. Prayers of
the private cults are almost entirely nonexistent. Later Babylonian
religion is rich in penitential psalms written in Sumerian
for use in private devotions. These are known by the rubric
erÅ¡agÄ£unga, or prayers to appease the heart. Only one has been
found in the Nippur collection,22
and none at all have been
recovered elsewhere. Seals of Sumerians showing them in
[pg 241]
the act of saying their private prayers abound from the earliest
period. Most of these seals represent the worshipper saluting
a deity with a kiss thrown with the hand. The attitude was
described as Å¡u-illa, or âLifting of the Hand.â Semitic
prayers of the lifting of the hand abound in the religion of Babylonia
and Assyria. Here they are prayers employed in the incantation
ritual. We know from the great catalogue of Sumerian liturgical
literature compiled by the Assyrians that the Sumerians had a
large number of prayers of the lifting of the hand.23 In Sumerian
religion these were apparently purely private prayers unconnected
with the rituals of atonement. At any rate the Nippur collections
in Constantinople and Philadelphia contain a large number
of incantation services for the atonement of sinners and the
afflicted. These resemble and are the originals of the Assyrian
incantation texts of the type utukku limnuti, and contain no
prayers either by priest (kiÅ¡ub in later terminology is the rubric
of priest's prayers in incantations) or by penitent (Å¡u-il-la's).
The absence of prayers of private devotion in the temple library
of Nippur is absolutely inexplicable. Does it mean that the
Sumerians were so deficient in providing for the religious cure
of the individual? Their emphasis of the social solidarity of
religion is truly in remarkable contrast to the religious individualism
of the Semite. But the Sumerian historical inscriptions
often contain remarkable prayers of individuals. The seals emphasize
the act of private devotion. The catalogue of their
prayers states that they possessed a good literature for private
devotions. When one considers the evidence which induces to
assume that they possessed such a literature, its total absence
in every Sumerian collection is an enigma which the writer
fails to explain.

[pg 242]

In the introduction to part two of this volume24 the writer
has emphasized the peculiarly rich collection of tablets in this
collection pertaining to the cults of deified kings. In the present
part is published a most important tablet of that class. This
liturgy of the compiled type in six kiÅ¡ubs sung in the cult of the
god-man Ishme-Dagan, fourth king of the Isin dynasty, is
unique in the published literature of Sumer. Its musical intricacy
and theological importance have been duly defined on pages
245-247. With the publication of these texts the important
song services of the cults of deified kings are exhausted. In
addition to the texts of this class translated or noted in part
two, I call attention to the very long text concerning Dungi,
king of Ur, published by Barton,
Miscellaneous Babylonian
Inscriptions No. 3. In that extremely long poem in six columns
of about 360 lines25 there are no rubrics, which shows at once
that it is not a cult song service. Moreover, Dungi had not
been deified when the poem was written. It is really an historical
poem to this king whose deification had at any rate not yet
been recognized at Nippur. It belongs in reality to the same
class of literature as the historical poem on his father Ur-Engur,
translated on pages 126-136.


The only Sumerian cult songs to deified kings not in the
Nippur collection have now been translated by the writer and
made accessible for wider study. One hymn to Ur-Engur
which proves that he had been canonized at his capitol in Ur
will be found in the Proceedings of the Society of Biblical
Literature, 1918, 45-50. The twelfth song of a liturgy to Ishme-Dagan
published by Zimmern from the Berlin collection is translated
on pages 52-56 of the same article. Finally a long liturgy to
[pg 243]
Libit-Ishtar, son of Ishme-Dagan, likewise in Berlin, has been
translated there on pages 69-79.26 Since the Berlin texts
probably came from Sippar their existence in that cult is
important. For they prove not only the practice of cult worship
of deified kings in that city, but the domination of Isin
over this north Semitic city is thus documented for a period as
late as Libit-Ishtar.


Nearly all the existing prayer services in the cults of the
deified kings of Ur and Isin are now published and translated.
The student will observe that they are all of the compiled type
but that there is in most cases much musical arrangement and
striving for combined effect. A few, and especially the Ishme-Dagan
liturgy published as No. 1 of this part, reveal theological
speculation and an effort to give the institution of god-man
worship its proper place in their religion. The hymns of
these cults comparatively so richly represented in this volume
will be among the most interesting groups of religious texts
supplied by the excavations at Nippur.27


Oxford, July 9, 1919.


[pg 245]



Lamentation of Ishme-Dagan Over Nippur. 13856 (No. 1)

The liturgical character of this tablet is unique among all
the numerous choral compositions of the Isin period. It is a large
two column tablet containing six long kiÅ¡ub melodies. Liturgies
of such kind, compiled by joining a series of kiÅ¡ubs, or melodies,
attended by prostrations, represent an advanced stage in the
evolution of these compositions in that the sections are not
mechanically joined together by selecting older melodies without
much regard for their connection, but as a whole they are apparently
original compositions so arranged that they develop a motif
from the beginning to the end of the liturgy. Choral services
composed of kiÅ¡ubs in the cults of deified kings have been
found28
wherein the deeds and personality of the king are sung, his divine
claims are emphasized and his Messianic promises rehearsed. But
the liturgy here published resembles in literary style the classical
lamentations which always formed the chief temple services of
Sumer and Babylonia. It more especially resembles the weeping
mother liturgies, but here Ishme-Dagan appears in the lines of
the service in a rÃ´le similar to that of the sorrowful mother
goddess of the ordinary liturgies, as he weeps for Nippur.


âHer population like cattle of the fields within her have
perished. Helas my land I sigh.â


So reads a line from the second melody.

[pg 246]

Lines of similar character occur repeatedly in the laments
of the mother goddess as she weeps for her people in the standard
liturgies. In other words, the cult of the deified kings issues here
into its logical result. The god man created to live and die for
his people usurps the sphere of the earth mother herself. And
like her he is intimately associated with the fortunes of mankind,
of nature and all living creatures. The great gods and the hosts
of their attendants rule over man and the various phases of the
universe from afar. But the mother goddess is the incarnation
of fruitful nature, the mother of man whose joys and sorrows she
feels. So also in this remarkable liturgy the deified son of the
great gods lives among men, becomes their patron and divine
companion.


The tablet contained originally about fifty lines in each
column, or 200 in all. About one-third of the first column is
gone. The first melody contained at least fifty lines and ended
somewhere shortly after the first line of Col. II of the obverse.
It began by relating how Enlil had ordered the glory of Nippur,
and then had become angered against his city, sending upon it
desolation at the hands of an invader. When we take up the
first lines of Obv. II we are well into the second melody which
represents Ishme-Dagan mourning for fathers and mothers who
had been separated from their children; for brothers who had
been scattered afar; for the cruel reign of the savage conqueror
who now rules where the dark-headed people had formerly
dwelled in peace.


At about the middle of Obv. II begins the third melody
which consists of 38 lines extending to Rev. I 19. In this section
the psalmist ponders upon the injustice of his city's fate, and
looks for the time when her woes will cease, and Enlil will be
reconciled.

[pg 247]

The fourth section begins at line 24 of Rev. I and ended
near the bottom of this column which is now broken away.
Here Ishme-Dagan joins with the psalmists weeping for Nippur.


Section 5 began near the end of Rev. I, and ends at line 16
of Rev. II. Here begins the phase of intercession to Enlil to
repent and revenge Nippur upon the foe. Section 6, beginning
at Rev. II 17, probably continued to the end of the column and
the tablet. Here the liturgy promises the end of Nippur's sorrow.
Enlil has ordered the restoration of his city and has sent Ishme-Dagan,
his beloved shepherd, to bring joy unto the people.


After sections 2 and 3 follows the antiphon of one or two
lines. The ends of sections 1 and 4 are lost but we may
suppose that antiphons stood here also. Section 5 does not have
an antiphon. Since section 6 ended the liturgy it is not likely
that an antiphon stood there.

Psalm to Enlil Containing a Long Intercession
by the Mother Goddess. 15204 (No. 5)

This liturgical psalm in one melody adds one more document
of this kind to the classical Sumerian corpus of old short
musical services on which the later complex liturgies were based.162
The title, Ã¡rabu-(Ä£u) Ã¡rabu-(Ä£u) mÃºzu kÃºrra munmÃ¡llaÅ¡u zÃ¡e
almÃ©nna, arranged in seven dactyls, does not appear in the catalogue
of old songs given in the Assyrian list, IV Raw. 53 Col. III.
Since the greater part of the psalm consists in an address of the
mother goddess to Enlil on behalf of Nippur, the composition is
defined as an adoration of âmy mother,â163 an epithet applied to
Innini by the singers in most liturgies. The psalm begins with
twelve lines sung by the choir and addressed to Enlil. They
then in lines 13-15 introduce Innini whom they represent in
discourse before Enlil in lines 16-47. This part of the song
service contains refrains characteristic of public worship. Theologically
the text illustrates one of the most profound principles
of Sumerian religion, the sympathy and concern of the virgin
mother for mankind.164 The great daily services of the standard
prayer books represent her as a mater dolorosa and she
with Tammuz shares the vicissitudes of mortal life. Our text is
unique and noteworthy for one salient fact. It illustrates the
scenes so common on Babylonian seals, where the mother goddess
stands in intercession before the god, with one or both hands
raised in supplication and the left foot advanced as though about
to set it on the paved approach to the throne of the deity.

Lamentation on the Pillage of Lagash by the Elamites. 2154 (No. 6)

This neatly written but seriously damaged single column
tablet carried when complete about fifty-five lines. In style the
liturgical lamentation has a striking resemblance to the lamentation
[pg 269]
on the invasion of Sumer by the people of Gutium,
published in the author's Sumerian Liturgical Texts, 120-124.
The same refrain, âHow long? oh my destroyed city and my
destroyed temple, sadly I wail,â distinguishes both
compositions.183
Other lines are common to both threnodies. The contents are
similar to the lamentation on Lagash published in Cuneiform Texts
of the British Museum, Vol. XV 22, of which Zimmern has
published a variant VAT. 617 Rev. II 10-42, in his Sumerische
Kultleider. A translation of the British Museum text will be
found in the author's Sumerian and Babylonian Psalms, p. 284,
an edition which can now be improved.

Lamentation to Innini on the Sorrows of Erech. 13859 (Poebel No. 26)

This well preserved single column tablet is published by
Poebel in PBS. V 26. The composition reflects the standard
theological ideas found in the canonical psalms and liturgies.
The mother goddess Innini is represented as a divine mother
wailing for the misery of her city and her people. The calamity
[pg 273]
consists in the pillage of the city and its holy places by a foreign
invader, who is repeatedly compared to an ox. Like the ordinary
psalms of public service the singers abruptly introduce the
goddess speaking in the first person as in lines 16; 18-20; 33-4.
But the lamentation does not have refrains and at the end the
style approaches nearly that of a prayer. The tablet also bears
no liturgical note at the end. For these reasons and because of
the general impression which the lines leave with the present
interpreter, he classifies this text as the product of a scholastic
liturgist of the Ur or Isin period whose work was not incorporated
into the corpus of the official breviary.

Liturgical Hymn to Sin. 8097 (No. 7)

This liturgical composition consists of two melodies each
designated by the rubric sagarram,
âIt is a sagar.â The entire
service is sung to the tigÃ», a kind of flute. In the first melody
of fifteen lines the choir chant the glory of the moon god and
his city Ur. The second melody of twenty-four lines is apparently
an address of the earth god Enlil to his son the moon god.
This melody must remain obscure as long as the recurring
liturgical phrase Ã¡b-mu-ba-Å¡i-in-dib is unexplained.

Lamentation on the Destruction of Ur. 7080 (No. 11)

The fragment Ni. 7080 carries the right half of one of the
largest literary tablets in the Museum. Broken evenly at the
center from top to bottom the right half of this tablet preserves
part of Col. III and all of Cols. IV, V of the obverse. The reverse
correspondingly contains Cols. I, II and half of Col. III. Like
so many similar liturgical compositions of the period of Ur this
lamentation is divided into a series of kiÅ¡ubs or songs, here of
unusually great length. The third song ends at Obv. III 38;
[pg 280]
its first line stood in Obv. II, which has been lost. The fourth
song began at Obv. III 42 and ends at Obv. IV 23, containing
thirty-four lines. The fifth song begins at Obv. IV 27 and ends
at Obv. V 7, containing forty-seven lines. In the following pages
will be found a translation of twenty-three lines of the end of the
fourth song which describes the wrathful word of the gods Anu
and Enlil. The fifth song, a remarkable ode to the wrathful
word of Enlil, has been translated so far as the text permits.


The sixth song begins at Obv. V 11, and probably terminated
in the broken passage at the top of Rev. I. Its length was also
unusual, having at least forty-five lines. This song was edited
on a small tablet Ni. 4584 on which the beginning and the end
of the section are preserved. It has been published as No. 10
in Sumerian Liturgical Texts, Vol. X of the Publications of the
Babylonian Section. Only a few lines at the commencement of
this song have been translated here. From this point onward
the language of the liturgy presents such difficulty that the
writer has been unable to offer a translation.


Section seven probably ended at the top of Rev. II and
refers throughout to the mother goddess who weeps over the
ruins of Ur. The eighth song probably began at the top of
Rev. II and ended perhaps at the top of Rev. III. It is another
doleful ode to the weeping mother and many of its lines are
clear and translatable. The entire song is marked by sorrowful
refrains: me-li-e-a uru-mu nu-me-a, Oh woe is me, my city is
no more.242
a-uru-mu im-me, How long? oh my city I cry.243
me-li-e-a uru-ta Ã¨-a-mÃ¨n, Oh woe is me, from the city I
depart.244
dingir ga-Å¡a-an-gal-mÃ¨n Ã©-ta Ã¨-a-mÃ¨n, Great divine queen am I,
[pg 281]
from the temple I depart.245
er-gig ni-Å¡Ã©Å¡-Å¡Ã©Å¡, She weeps
bitterly.246


Only the ends of lines of a large part of the ninth song are
preserved in Rev. III. The tenth song probably occupied most
of the space in Rev. IV. Speculation concerning the number of
songs in the entire liturgy is limited to the number of about 11-13.
The liturgy was, therefore, extremely long, attaining to a content
of about 500 lines. We know from the single tablet variant of the
sixth song that another edition of this series existed in which
small tablets carried each a single kiÅ¡ub. A similar condition of
editorial redaction is revealed by Zimmern, KL. 200, a small
tablet which contains the twelfth song of a liturgy to the deified
king of Isin, IÅ¡me-Dagan.


The historical event referred to in this liturgy is undoubtedly
the destruction of Ur in the time of Ibi-Sin, last of the kings of the
Ur dynasty. This calamity left many traces in the temple songs
of Sumer, and the Sumerian prayer books of Nippur contain
other lamentations on the fall of Ur, written perhaps during the
Isin period. The writer has already published a single column
tablet which rehearses the same catastrophe, mentioning Ibi-Sin
himself and naming the Elamites as his captors.247

Liturgical Hymns of the Tammuz Cult. 3656 (Myhrman No. 5)

The obverse of this fine single column tablet contained a
hymn in thirty-eight lines to the departed Tammuz. It represents
the people wailing for the lord of life who now sleeps in
the lower world. Thirteen lines have been completely broken
away from the top. The reverse carried a long liturgical song
of the cult of this god in which the mother goddess is represented
wailing for her ravished lover. Songs of the weeping mother are
common enough in these wailings for Tammuz, but all other
known examples of this motif represent the major unmarried
type of mother goddess Innini-Ishtar wandering on earth, crying
for her departed son. The hymn on our tablet reveals in a
wholly unexpected manner the close relation between the mother
goddess Gula of Isin and Innini. It was known that both sprang
from a common source, a prehistoric unmarried goddess, but one
had hardly supposed that the liturgists went so far as to introduce
[pg 286]
the married goddess of Isin in the rÃ´le of the virgin mother
Innini. The great mother divinity of Isin, although attached in a
loose way to a male consort Ninurta, in that city retained, nevertheless,
much of her ancient unattached character. In the
standard liturgies she is almost invariably the type of Weeping
mother, whereas Innini is this type in the Tammuz liturgies.
Since Gula of Isin was the ordinary liturgical type we find the
influence of the ordinary liturgies effective in the composition
of the Tammuz hymn. It explains the extraordinary phenomenon
of the introduction of a long passage (Rev. 3-10) from one
of the wailing liturgies. And the short litany refrain lines 11-20
is obviously an imitation of numberless similar passages of the
ordinary liturgies in which the goddess wails for various temples;
here only for Nippur and Isin, since the composition was written
for the services at Nippur in the period of the Isin dynasty.
In a most gratifying manner our tablet shows how the lamentations
of the mother goddess in the canonical prayer books express
sorrows for certain concrete misfortunes and certain defined
temples and cities and find their general expression in the lamentations
for Tammuz, the representative of all human vicissitudes.
This edition has been made from my own copy. The tablet was
first published by Myhrman, PBS. Vol. I No.
5, and by Radau,
BE. 30 No. 2. To these copies I have been able to make only
slight additions.

A Liturgy to Enlil, Series e-lum gud-sun
(Zimmern KL. No. 11)

The history of the text of this long and intricate Enlil liturgy
elucidates in unusual manner the evolution of Sumerian prayer
books until they attained canonical and permanent form. The
earliest text of this liturgy is partially preserved on the Tablet
Virolleaud published in the Revue d'Assyriologie, Vol. XVI.
The fragment was brought to Europe in 1909 by the assyriologist
Charles Virolleaud, having been purchased by him during his
excavations in Persia. It is light brown and varies from the center
to the edge by two inches to one inch in thickness. The fragment
is from the upper left corner of a large three(?) column tablet.
About half of the first melody is preserved on the obverse. The
reverse preserves the last two melodies. From their rubrics we
learn that the entire series contained eleven sections. This tablet
has the rubric ki-Å¡ub-gÃº after each strophe. The titular
litany281
occupies as usual the next to the last place but only the opening
lines giving the motif and a few titles are given. The redactor
indicates the remaining titles by a rubric â(Recite the title) of a
[pg 291]
god until they are finished.â The rubric is in Semitic which
shows that the redaction was done by Semitic scholars.


The series as it finally issued from the hands of the liturgists
in the Isin period was written upon a huge five(?) column tablet,
the lower half of which has been published
by Zimmern, Altsumerische
Kultlieder, No. 11. Each column contained about
fifty lines. There are no giÅ¡-gÃ­-gal
or antiphons after the melodies,
ten of which I have been able to restore. By borrowing
from old songs and other liturgies the redactors have greatly
increased the length of this service. At least ten songs have
been lost on Cols. III, IV of the obverse and I, II of the reverse.


The late Assyrian redaction is mentioned in the catalogue
of prayer books IV Raw. 53 I 13 and in BL. No. 103 Obv. 13.
SBH. No. 21, edited in SBP. 112-119, is tablet one of the late
Babylonian School282
and contains the first four songs, duplicates of the first four
on K.L. 11. SBH. No. 25, edited in SBP. 120-123,283
carries on the obverse two songs (e-lum di-da-ra
and me-e ur-ri
men) found on Col. III of K.L. No. 11, Rev., or the two last
melodies before the titular litany. A fragment published by
Meek in BA. X pt. 1, No.
11, contains the end of e-lum di-da-ra
and all of me-e ur-ri men. SBH.
25 and Meek No. 11 belong
to the series e-lum di-da-ra, entered in the Assyrian catalogue,
IV Raw. 53a 8, and form tablet one of that
service.


The titular litany of the e-lum gud-sun series is identical
(except for some variants) with the famous titular litany of the
mother goddess series mu-ten NU-NUNUZ gim-ma,
tablet five,
edited in SBP. 149-167. Portions of the titular litany of the
Enlil series have been edited in PBS. X 155-167, see pages
163-4. The titular litany of nÃ­-ma-al gÃ¹-de-de occurs at the end
[pg 292]
of tablet two of that series, SBP. 24-9 = BL. 72-3. Not every
series has a theological litany of this kind, which ordinarily
comes before the er-Å¡em-ma, or intercessional song at the end.
The song to the âword,â which occurs in all series, is partially
preserved on Obv. III and begins a-ma-ru na-nam. The indispensable
song to the weeping mother comes just before the
titular litany. This little nine-line melody me-e ur-ri-mÃ¨n me-e
kÃ s-mÃ¨n must have been a national religious song. It was copied
into another Enlil song service as we have seen. The same song
introduces tablet four of an Innini series of which we have only
the end of tablet three, K. 2759, in BL. 93 f.


Finally the reader will note that the first song e-lum gud-sun
of this series has been copied into one of the tablets of ame
baranara, SBH. No. 22 = SBP. 126 f. A fragment of some
unknown series, K. 8603 = BL. 14 also employs this song in the
body of its text.

Early Form of the Series
d.Babbar-gim-Ã¨-ta
11359 (Myhrman No. 8)


Ni. 11359, published by Myhrman, PBS. I. No. 8, is the
left upper corner of a large four column tablet. It contained a
series of ki-Å¡ub melodies which formed the prototype of the later
Enlil series of which three tablets have been edited by the
writer, see Sumerian Liturgical Texts 167. It stands to the
completed series as the similar tablet of the e-lum gud-sun series,
Tablet Virolleaud, is related to its completed canonical form in
Zimmern, KL. 11. Both Ni. 11359 and Tablet Virolleaud show
the evolution of two great Enlil liturgies arrested midway in
their evolution. They still consist of unmethodically joined
melodies. Both have the same rubric at the end. The first
melody of d.Babbar-gim-Ã¨-ta
after line four agrees with the first
melody of the Enlil series zi-bu-Ã¹ sud-du-Ã¡m
in Zimmern, KL. 8
and 9 after line five of that series. A duplicate will be found in
BL. pp. 37-39, which see for critical notes on the reconstructed
text.

Liturgy of the Cult of Kes
(Nippur Fragments and Ashmolean Prism.)

KeÅ¡ and Opis, two closely associated but unlocated southern
cities of Sumer, lay apparently somewhere in the region between
Erech and Å uruppak. So closely were they united that the same
cult of the great mother goddess obtained in both.413 According
to II Raw. 60a 26, Innini of Hallab was the queen of KeÅ¡. The
Sumerian liturgy, BL. p. 54, names Nintud as the goddess of
this city, but the list of mother goddesses in PSBA. 1911 Pl. XII
calls her by the name Ninharsag,414 where she is associated with
Ninmenna, epithet of the earth mother in Adab a city near
Å uruppak. A fragment, No. 102 in BL., reads her title at KeÅ¡
as Aruru. These various epithets all refer to the earth mother
whose principal married type is Ninlil. In fact one liturgy
actually names Ninlil as the goddess of KeÅ¡, SBP. 24, 74. On
the other hand, a cult document of the Neo-Babylonian period
names Kallat Ekur, the bride of Ekur, as the goddess of U-pi-ia
or Opis, VS. VI. 213, 21.415 The bride of Ekur is Ninlil. Thus the
twin cities KeÅ¡ and Opis of Sumer with their cult of the earth
mother Ninharsag or Nintud were imitated in later times in
Akkad and located on the Tigris where Opis survived into Greek
times (ÏÏÎ¹Ï) and KeÅ¡ seems to have become confused in writing
with KiÅ¡ a famous city near Babylon. At Opis in Akkad a male
satellite Igi-du was associated with the mother goddess and we
[pg 312]
may be safe in assuming that he was borrowed from the original
southern cult.416 Of the names Ninharsag, Aruru, Nintud,
Ninmah, Innini of Hallab, we are not certain which one applied
especially to KeÅ¡ and Opis. In any case the liturgy which we
are about to discuss had some special name for the goddess here.
In a refrain which recurs at the end of each melody the psalmists
say that the god of KeÅ¡, that is probably Igidu,417 was made like
AÅ¡Å¡irgi, or Ninurta, and that its goddess was made like Nintud,
hence the special name of the mother goddess in this liturgy
cannot have been Nintud.


So far as the text of this important liturgy in eight melodies
can be established, it leads to the inference that, like all other
Sumerian choral compositions, the subject is the rehearsal of
sorrows which befell a city and its temple. Here the glories of
KeÅ¡, its temple and its gods are recorded in choral song, and the
woes of this city are referred to as symbolic of all human misfortunes.
The name of the temple has not been preserved in
the text. But we know from other liturgies that the temple in
KeÅ¡ bore the name UrÅ¡abba.418
The queen of the temple UrÅ¡abba
is called the mother of Negun, also a title of Ninurta in Elam.419
The close connection between the goddess of KeÅ¡ and Ninlil
is again revealed, for Negun is the son of Ninlil in the theological
lists, CT. 24, 26, 112. Therefore at KeÅ¡ we have a reflection of the
Innini-Tammuz cult or the worship of mother and son, mother
goddess Ninlil or Ninharsag, and Igidu or Negun.420

[pg 313]

KeÅ¡ and Opis must have been closely associated with both
Erech and Å uruppak, and of traditional veneration in Sumer.
KeÅ¡ is mentioned in a list with Ur, Kullab (part of Erech) and
Å uruppak, Smith, Miscellaneous
Texts 26, 5. Gudea speaks of
a part of the temple in Lagash which was pure as KeÅ¡ and Aratta
(i. e. Å uruppak).421 The various mother goddesses of Eridu,
Kullab, KÃªÅ¡i, LagaÅ¡ and Å uruppak are invoked in an incantation,
CT. 16, 36, 1-9. The first melody of the Ashmolean Prism
contains a reference to the horse of Å uruppak.


The textual history of this liturgy is interesting. The
major text is written upon a four-sided prism now in the
Ashmolean Museum of Oxford. The object is eight inches high,
four inches wide on each surface and is pierced from top to
bottom at the center by a small hole, so that the liturgy could
be turned on a spindle. The writer published a copy of this
prism or prayer wheel in his Babylonian Liturgies. The elucidation
of this exceedingly difficult text was lightened somewhat
by the discovery of a four column tablet in Constantinople,
which originally contained the entire text. It was afterwards
published as No. 23 of my Historical and Religious Texts. Since
the edition of these two sources, the Nippur Collection in Philadelphia
has been found to contain several fragments of the same
liturgy. A portion of the redaction on several single column
tablets had been already published by Radau in his
Miscellaneous
Sumerian Texts, No. 8 (=Ni. 11876), last tablet of the series
containing melodies six, seven, and eight. I failed to detect the
connection of Radau's tablet at the time of the first edition
but referred to it with a rendering in my Epic of Paradise, p. 19.
[pg 314]
Another tablet, also from a single column tablet redaction at
Nippur, has been recovered in Philadelphia, Ni. 8384.422 This
text utilized here in transcription contains a section marked
number 4 on that tablet but all the other sources omit it.
Hence this redaction probably contained nine melodies.
The new melody has been inserted between melodies three
and four of the standard text. If evidence did not point
otherwise the editor would have supposed that Ni. 8384
and 11876 belonged to the same tablet. But Ni. 8384 has
melodies four, five and six of its redaction with the catch-line
of the next or its seventh melody which partly duplicates
the Radau tablet. Moreover, these two tablets have not
the same handwriting and differ in color and texture of the
clay. Finally a small fragment, Ni. 14031, contains the end of
the second melody and the beginning of the third on its obverse.
The reverse contains the end of the sixth melody. This small
tablet undoubtedly belongs to the four column tablet in Constantinople.
The two fragments became separated by chance
when the Nippur Collection was divided between Philadelphia
and the MusÃ©e Imperial of Turkey. Ni. 14031 will be found in
my Sumerian Liturgical Texts, No. 22.


Under ordinary circumstances a text for which so many
duplicates exist should have yielded better results than I have
been able to produce. But the contents are still obscure owing
largely to the bad condition of the prism. My first rendering
of the interesting refrain in which I saw a reference to the creation
of man and woman was apparently erroneous. The refrain
refers rather to the creation of the mother goddess of KeÅ¡ and
to her giving birth to her son Negun.423

Third Tablet of the Series âThe Exalted One
Who Walkethâ (e-lum didara)
(No. 13)

The series elum didara is entered in the Assyrian liturgical
catalogue, IV Raw. 53a 8, and the first tablet of this Enlil
liturgy has been found in the Berlin collection and published by
Reisner,
SBH. No. 25.477
The Berlin tablet belongs to a great
Babylonian temple library of the Greek period redacted by a
family of liturgists descendants of Sin-ibni. A fragment of the
same first tablet of another Babylonian copy has been found,
BM. 81-7-27, 203.478 The catch line of tablet two is lost on
SBH. 25 and no part of tablet two has been identified. In 1914
[pg 324]
I copied BM. 78239 (=88-5-12, 94) the upper half of a large
tablet carrying according to the colophon ninety-six Sumerian
lines. The number of lines provided with an interlinear translation
on this fragment is only two, which increases the actual
number of lines to ninety-eight. Probably a few more should
be added for Semitic lines on the lost portion. This tablet,
also from a Babylonian redaction, belongs to an edition made
by another school of liturgists and contains tablet three of
elum didara.


The third tablet of elum didara began with
a melody nin-ri
nin-ri gÃ»-am-me to the mother goddess Bau (I. 2), who in line 7 is
identified with NanÃ¢. Lines 3-6 introduce by interpolation other
local forms of the mother goddess, as a concession to cities whose
liturgists succeeded in inserting these lines before the canon of
sacred songs were closed in the Isin period. Hence Babylon is
favored by a reference to Zarpanit in line 3; Barsippa by a reference
to TaÅ¡met in lines 4-6. Bau or Gula wails for Nippur whose
destruction is here attributed to the moon-god, Sin. The
introduction of a long passage to the moon-god in the weeping
mother melody of an Enlil liturgy is unusual. The entire passage
reflects the phraseology and ideas of the well-known Sumerian
hymn to the moon-god magur azag anna.479 The composer desiring
to utilize these fine lines makes a setting for them by describing
Sin as the god who visited Nippur with wrath, regardless of
the inconsistency of placing such a passage in an Enlil song
service which attributed the sorrows of Nippur to Enlil himself.


According to the catch line of tablet two of the Ninurta
liturgy gud-nim kurra the third tablet of that series began by
the same melody as tablet three of the elum
didara.480 It is probable
[pg 325]
that the first melody of tablet three of both series was
identical. Melodies are always identified by their first lines and
when these agree we assume that the entire melodies are
identical. Since the musicians referred to all melodies by their
first lines it was manifestly impossible to begin two different
melodies with the same line. But tablet three of the weeping
mother liturgy muten nu-nunuz-gim
begins its first melody481 nin-ri
nin-ri gÃ¹-Ã¡m, etc., otherwise both melodies differ completely.
This is the first known of example of two different melodies
bearing the same title. It is curious indeed that an Enlil, a
Ninurta and a mater dolorosa series all begin their third
tablets in the same manner.


The obverse of BM. 78239 breaks away before the end of
the melody nin-ri ninri gÃº-Ã¡m-me. Here forty-five Sumerian
lines are lost; one or two melodies at least stood in this break.
For the last passage on tablet three, the scribe borrows the first
melody of the Ninurta series gud-nim kurra.482 The litanies which
begin these melodies or series of addresses to Ninurta differ
greatly in the two redactions. Since SBH. No. 18 belongs to a
Ninurta series the addresses therein are much more extensive.
The composer of the Enlil series elum didara obviously introduced
this irrelevant melody to obtain the fine passage to the weeping
mother, Rev. 10-21 on BM. 78239. These lines are lost on the
Berlin text SBH. No. 18. On the whole the liturgy elum didara
is more inconsistent in the development of ideas than any song
service of which extensive portions are known. Only tablets
one and three are as yet identified and neither of these is much
more than half complete.

Babylonian Cult Symbols. 6060 (No. 12)

Ni. 6060, a Cassite tablet in four columns, yields a notable
addition to the scant literature we now possess concerning Babylonian
mystic symbols. A fragmentary Assyrian copy from the
library of AÅ¡urbanipal was published by Zimmern as No. 27
of his Ritual Tafeln. The Assyrian copy contains only fifteen
symbols with their mystic identifications, in Col. II of the
obverse. The ends of the lines of the right half of Col. I are
preserved on Zimmern 27, and these are all restored by the
Cassite original. The obverse of these two restored tablets contained
about sixty symbols with their divine implications. Most of
them are the names of plants, metals, cult utensils and sacrificial
animals, each being identified with a deity. A tablet in the
British Museum, dated in the 174th year of the Seleucid era or
138 B. C., Spartola Collection I 131, published by Strassmaier,
ZA. VI 241-4, begins with an astronomical myth concerning the
summer and winter solstices503
and then inserts a passage on the
mystic meanings of ten symbols. The myth of the solstices
runs as follows:


âIn the month Tammuz, 11th day, when the deities Miniá¹­á¹­i
and Kaá¹­una, daughters of Esagila,504
go unto Ezida505 and in the
month Kislev, 3d day, when the deities Gazbaba and Kazalsurra,
daughters of Ezida, go unto EsagilaâWhy do they go? In the
month Tammuz the nights are short. To lengthen the nights
the daughters of Esagila go unto Ezida. Ezida is the house of
[pg 331]
night. In the month Kislev, when the days are short, the
daughters of Ezida to lengthen the days go unto Esagila. Esagila
is the house of day.â The tablet then explains the Sumerian
ideogram gubarra=AÅ¡rat, the western mother goddess Ashtarte,
and says that AÅ¡rat of Ezida is poverty
stricken.506 But AÅ¡rat of
Esagila is full of light and
mighty.507 Some mystic connection
between AÅ¡rat or GeÅ¡tinanna, mistress of letters and astrology,508
scribe of the lower world, and the daughters of night and day
existed. This cabalistic tablet here refers to a mirror which she
holds in her hand and says she appeared on the 15th day to
order the decisions. The 15th of the month Tammuz is probably
referred to or the beginning of the so-called dark period when the
days begin to shorten and Nergal the blazing sun descends to the
lower world to remain 160 days.509 For some reason AÅ¡rat, here
called the queen,510 appears to order the
decisions, probably the fates of those that die. The phrase âThe
divine queen appearedâ
is usually said of the rising of stars or astral bodies, but the
reference here is wholly obscure. As a star she was probably
Virgo. At any rate some mystic pantomime must have been
enacted in the month of Tammuz in which the daughters of
Esagila and Ezida and the queen recorder of Sheol were the
principal figures. The pantomime represented the passing of
light, the reign of night and the judgment of the dead. Clearly
an elaborate ritual attended by magic ceremonies characterized
the ceremony. At this point the tablet gives a commentary on
[pg 332]
the mystic meaning of cult objects used for the healing of the
sick or the atonement of a sinner. Obviously some connection
exists between this mystagogy and the myth described. The
commentary is probably intended to explain the hidden powers
of the objects employed in the weird ritual, at any rate the
mystery is thus explained.511


(1) Gypsum is the god Ninurta.512 (2) Pitch is the asakku-demon.513
(3) Meal water (which encloses the bed of the sick man) is
Lugalgirra and Meslamtaea.514
[A string of wet meal was laid about
the bed of a sick man or about any object to guard them against
demons. Hence meal water symbolizes the two gods who guard
against demons. See especially Ebeling, KTA. No. 60 Obv. 8
zisurrÃ¡ talamme-Å¡u, âThou shalt enclose him with meal water.â]


(4) Three meal cakes are Anu, Enlil and Ea.515 (5) The design
which is drawn before the bed is the net which overwhelms all
evil. (6) The hide of a great bull is Anu. [Here the hide of the
bull is the symbol of the heaven god as of Zeus DolichaÃ®os in
Asia Minor.]


(7) The copper gong516 is Enlil. But in our tablet II 13 symbol
of Nergal and in CT. 16, 24, 25 apparently of Anu. The term
of comparison in any case is noise, bellowing.


(8) The great reed spears which are set up at the head of the
[pg 333]
sick man are the seven great gods sons of IÅ¡hara. The seven
sons of IÅ¡hara are unknown, but this goddess was a water and
vegetation deity closely connected with Nidaba goddess of the
reed.517 The reed, therefore, symbolizes her sons.


(9) The scapegoat is NinamaÅ¡azagga. Here the scapegoat
typifies the genius of the flocks who supplies the goat. See,
however, another explanation below Obv. II 17.


(10) The censer is Azagsud. The deity Azagsud in both
theological and cult texts is now male and now female. As a
male deity he is the great priest of Enlil, CT. 24, 10, 12, and
always a god of lustration closely connected with the fire god
Gibil, Meek, BA. X pt. 1 No. 24,4.518
But ordinarily Azagsud is
a form of the grain goddess who was also associated with fire in
the rites of purification. As a title of the grain goddess, see
CT. 24, 9, 35 = 23, 17; SBP. 158, 64 A-sug
where Zimmern,
KL. 11 Rev. III 11 has Azag-sug. She is frequently associated
with Niná¸«abursildu and Nidaba (the grain goddess) in rituals,
Zimmern, Rt. 126, 27 and 29; 138, 14, etc. The censer probably
symbolizes both male and female aspects, the fire that burns
and the grain that is burned. See below II 9, where the censer
is symbol of UrashÃ¢ a god of light.


(11) The torch is Nusku the fire god in the Nippur pantheon.
Below (II 10) the torch is Gibil, fire god in the Eridu pantheon.


The mystic identifications do not always agree, but the term
of comparison can generally be found if the origin and character
of the deities are known and the nature of the symbol determined.
Each god was associated with an animal and a plant and with
other forms of nature over which they presided. When the cult
utensils are symbols the term of comparison is generally clear.
[pg 334]
Below will be found such interpretations of these mysteries as
the condition of the tablet and the limits of our knowledge permit.
Most difficult of all are the metal symbols which begin with
Obv. I 10. Here silver is heaven, but it can hardly be explained
after the manner of the same connection of Zeus DolichaÃ®os
with silver in Kommagene. The cult of this Asiatic heaven
god is said to have been chiefly practiced at a city in the region
of silver mines.519
That is an impossible explanation in the case
of Anu whose chief cult center was at Erech. The association
of gold with Enmesharra, here obviously the earth god, is completely
unintelligible. In Obv. I 31 he is possibly associated with
lead or copper as the planet Saturn. In lines I 14-18 the symbols
are broken away, but they are probably based upon astronomy.
Metals seem to be connected with fixed stars and planets on the
principle of color. The metallic symbolism of the planets was
well known to Byzantine writers who did not always agree in
these matters. Their identifications are certainly a GrÃ¦co-Roman
heritage which in turn repose upon Babylonian tradition.520
The following table taken from Cook,
Zeus, p. 626, will illustrate
GrÃ¦co-Roman ideas on this point:


Kronosâlead (Saturn); Zeusâsilver (Jupiter); Aresâiron
(Mars); Heliosâgold (Sun); Aphroditeâtin (Venus); Hermesâbronze
(Mercury); Seleneâcrystal (Moon).


Our tablet preserves only the names of the deities at this
[pg 335]
point, and if metals stood at the left we are clearly authorized
to interpret the divine names in their astral sense. This assumes,
of course, that these astral identifications obtained in the Cassite
period. Assuming this hypothesis we should have the metals
for Betelgeuze, Ursa Major, Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Saturn,
New-moon(?), a star in Orion, Venus as evening and morning
star, Virgo, and perhaps others.


The reverse of the tablet is even more mystic and subtle.
The first section connects various cult substances with parts of
the body. White wine and its bottle influence the eyes. White
figs pertain to a woman's breasts. Must or mead have power
over the limbs as the members of motion. Terms of comparison
fail to suggest themselves here and we are completely disconcerted
by the fancy of the Babylonian mystagogue. In the
next section, which is only partially preserved, we have twelve
gods of the magic rituals. The province of each in relation to the
city and state is defined. Kushu, the evil satyr who receives the
sin-bearing scapegoat, hovers over the homes of men. Muá¸«ru,
the deity who receives burnt offerings, or incarnation of the fires
of sacrifice, dwells at the city-gate. Sakkut, a god of light and
war, inexplicably protects the pools. Then follow hitherto
undefined and unknown Cassite deities and a break in the
tablet.


As in the Assyrian duplicate, Zimmern Rt. 27, so also here,
the reverse contains a lexicographical commentary on mythological
phrases. The name of the god Negun is commented upon
here and most timely information is given. Both the phonetic
reading of the name and the character of the deity are defined.
The colophon at the end has the usual formula attached to cult
instructions whose contents are forbidden to the uninitiated.

Addendum On Obv. I 10 F.

Anu in this passage really denotes Sin, the moon, which
has been connected with silver on account of its color. The
identification of Anu, the heaven god, with the moon god rests
upon the astronomical connection between the moon and the
summer solstice, see Weidner,
Handbuch der Babylonischen
Astronomie, 32. Sin is called âAnu of heaven,â
King, Magic,
No. I, 9, and for the connection with silver, see Virolleaud,
Astrologie, Supplement, V II,
kaspu ilu A-nu huraá¹£u
ilu Enlil
erÃ» ilu Ea.
Enlil is connected with gold in Virolleaud,
Astrologie, Second Supplement, XVII
14, and Enlil is not infrequently
identified with Shamash, see p. 158, 1-2 and p. 308, 18,
and gold is the traditional metal of the sun.


The Greek identification of Zeus, the sky-god, with silver is
certainly borrowed from Babylonia; see p. 334.

Footnotes
1.In
addition to the examples of epical poems and hymns cited on pages 103-5 of this volume
note the long mythological hymn to Innini, No. 3
and the hymn to Enlil, No. 10 of this
part. An unpublished hymn to Enlil, Ni. 9862, ends a-a
dEn-lil zag-sal, âO praise father Enlil.â
For Ni. 13859, cited above p. 104, see Poebel, PBS. V No.
26.2.So far as the term is properly applied. Being of didactic
import it was finally attached to grammatical texts in the phrase
dNidaba
zag-sal, âO praise Nidaba,â i. e., praise the patroness
of writing.3.Poebel, PBS.
V No. 25; translated in the writer's
Le PoÃ¨me SumÃ©rien du Paradis, 220-257.
Note also a similar epical poem to Innini partial duplicate of
Poebel No. 25 in
Myhrman's
Babylonian Hymns and Prayers, No. 1.
Here also the principal actors are Enki, his messenger
Isimu, and âHoly Inniniâ as in the better preserved epic. Both are poems on the
exaltation of Innini.4.Ni. 9205 published
by Barton,
Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions, No. 4. This text
is restored by a tablet of the late period
published by Pinches in JRAS. 1919.5.Ni. 7847, published in this part, No. 3 and partially translated
on pages 260-264.6.Undoubtedly Ni. 11327, a mythological hymn to Enki in
four columns, belongs to this class.
It is published as No. 14 of this part. A similar zagsal to Enki
belongs to the Constantinople
collection, see p. 45 of my Historical and Religious Texts.7.Historical
and Religious Texts, pp. 14-18.8.See PSBA. 1919, 34.9.One of the most
remarkable tablets in the Museum is Ni. 14005, a didactic poem in 61 lines
on the period of pre-culture and institution of Paradise by the earth god and the water
god in Dilmun. Published by Barton,
Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions, No. 8. The writer's
exegesis of this tablet will be found in Le PoÃ¨me SumÃ©rien du
Paradis, 135-146. It is not called a
zag-sal probably because the
writer considered the tablet too small to be dignified by that rubric.
Similar short mythological poems which really belong to the
zag-sal group are the following:
hymn to Shamash, Radau,
Miscel. No. 4; hymn to Ninurta as creator of canals,
Radau, BE.
29, No. 2, translated in BL., 7-11; hymn to Nidaba,
Radau, Miscel. No. 6.10.Ni.
112; see pp. 172-178.11.For example, Myhrman, No. 3;
Radau, Miscel. No. 13; both canonical
prayer books of the weeping mother class. For a liturgy of the completed composite
type in the Tammuz cult, see Radau, BE. 30, Nos. 1, 5,
6, 8, 9.12.See

the accompaniment. See SBP. p. ix.22.See page 118 in part 2.23.See IV Raw. 53,

106-109.25.Less than half the tablet is
preserved.26.Note that this breviary of
the cult of Libit-Ishtar terminates with two ancient songs, one
to Innini and one to NinÃ¢, both types of the mother goddess
who was always intimately connected
with the god-men as their divine mother.27.For a list of
the abbreviations employed in this volume, see page 98 of Part I.28.The twelfth kiÅ¡ub of a liturgy to
Ishme-Dagan is published in Zimmern's
Kultlieder, No. 200.
A somewhat similar song service of the cult of this king has been
published in the writer's Sumerian
Liturgical Texts, 178-187. A portion of a series to Dungi was published
by Radau in the Hilprecht
Anniversary Volume, No. 1. The liturgy to Libit-Ishtar in
Zimmern, K L. 199 IâRev. I 7, is
composed of a series of sa-(bar)-gid-da.29.na-ba- is for
nam-ba, emphatic prefix. See PBS. X pt. 1 p. 76 n. 4.
Cf. na-ri-bi, verily she
utters for thee, BE. 30, No. 2, 20.30.On the philological meaning of
this name, see VAB. IV 126, 55.31.For the suffixes
eÅ¡, uÅ¡, denoting plural of the object,
see Sum. Gr. p. 168.32.On
ki-dÃºr-gar cf. Gudea, Cyl. B 12, 19.33.Usually written
dÃ¹-azag, throne room. On the meaning of

The ban may he elude, Ni. 11065 Rev. II 25. Unpublished. The line is not entirely clear;
cf. BrÃ¼nnow, No. 3275.38.For en-na in the
sense of âwhile,â see Pery, Sin
in LSS. page 41, 16.39.The sign is imperfectly made on
the tablet.40.Cf. SBP.
328, 11.41.á¸ªA is probably identical in
usage with PEÅ , and the idea common to both is âbe many,
extensive, abundant.â Note Zimmern,
Kultlieder 19 Rev. has á¸ªA where SBP. 12,
2 has PEÅ .
Å¡u-peÅ¡ occurs in Gudea, Cyl. A 16, 23; 11, 9; 19, 9 and
CT. 15, 7, 27.42.On
ugu-de = á¸alÄku, na'butu, to run away, see
Delitzsch, Glossar p. 43. Also
ugu-bi-an-de-e,
V R. 25a 17; Ã¹-gÃ¹-dÃ©, RA. 10, 78, 14;
Ãº-gu ba-an-dÃ©, if he run away, VS. 13, 72 9

gÃº-sa-bi is expected; cf. RA. 11, 145, 31
gÃº-sa-bi = napá¸«ar-Å¡u-nu.44.Sign obliterated; the traces resemble SU.45.Read perhaps
dÅ«-Å¡ub = nadÃ» Å¡a rigmi, to shout loudly.
Cf. dÃºg sir-ra Å¡ub-ba-a-zu = rigme
zarbiÅ¡ addiki, ASKT. 122, 12. Passim in astrological texts.46.The tablet has
MAÅ . The Semitic would be
adi mati kabattu iparrad.47.ri is apparently an emphatic
element identical in meaning with Ã¡m; cf. SBP. 10, 7-12.
Note ri, variant of nam, SBH. 95,

Rev. 17.54.This compound verb
di-e-sud here for the first time. di-e
is probably connected with de
to flee. At the end AÅ  is written for AN.
Read a-Ã¡Å¡ and construe Å¡eÅ¡ as a
plural?55.gul
= kalÃ», restrain, is ordinarily construed with the infinitive
alone; Å¡e-du nu-uÅ¡-gul-e-en
= damÄma ul ikalla, Lang. B.L. 80, 25; SBH. 133, 65; 66, 15,
etc.56.Confirms SAI. 6507 = uá¸³á¸³u,

The phrase refers obviously to the mother
goddess. âHer sonâ must be interpreted figuratively in the sense that the mother
goddess is the protector of all human creatures.305.This
title gaÅ¡an-sun or nin-sun, really
means beltu rimtu, âthe wild-cow queen,â and characterizes
the ancient mother goddess as patroness of cattle. The title usually refers to the married
type Gula or Bau, as in SBP. 284, 19, and note that Ninsun, mother of Gilgamish, is
frequently called ri-mat, Poebel, OLZ,

this line begins an Enlil melody within the body of a series. Originally
a-gal-gal Å¡el-su-su was a Nergal melody and a series based upon
it is catalogued in IV R. 53a 33 of which
K. 69 is the first tablet. See also BÃ¶llenrÃ¼cher,
Nergal, No. 6.309.The late
redaction of this melody revises this litany with the new liturgical movement

this scheme is employed all feminine
deities are omitted. See SBP. 114. Note 5 p. 115 ibid.

Ninmah, SAK. 237e.415.Here the god of Opis is given as Igidu, a
form of Nergal. In this late text Opis on the
Tigris at Seleucia is probably intended. The southern KeÅ¡ and Opis were imitated in Akkad,
at any rate in later times, and KeÅ¡ was apparently confused with KiÅ¡ which gave rise to
a second KiÅ¡ in Akkad. The ancient and historical KiÅ¡ at Oheimer on the canal
of the Euphrates should not be confused with KiÅ¡ corruption for the new KeÅ¡ near
Seleucia.416.The god Igi-du of

mother goddesses in various cities. CT. 25, 24 K. 8219, 17+K. 7620, 18,

Ninurta in Nippur. A syllabary recently published by
Scheil (RA. 14, 174 I. 7)
explains the name by bit gi-mir

Note, however, the epithet Ã© i-dÃ©-ila =
bit niÅ¡ Ã®nÃª, House of the lifting of the eyes, SBP. 208,

epithet of the temple of Urta in Dilbat,
Ibe-iluAnum.
For this reading I-be
see vars. I-bi, Im-bi, BL. p. 134. The word
ibi is probably Sumerian for igi, and
shows that the phonetic rendering i-de is erroneous.
The dialectic pronunciation of igi was
ibe and despite the Semitic variant
imbi the name is apparently Sumerian
Ibe-Anu, Temple of the eye of Anu.
Here Å¡u-gÃºd is an epithet for Anu, i. e. the lofty.498.See also SBH. 132, 46;

the Babylonian GeÅ¡tinanna and Nidaba.
Hence [BÃªlit-]á¹£Ãªri is
dupÅ¡arrat irá¹£itm, scribe of the lower world, K.B.

Gypsum, Sum. im-bar, âradiant clay,â became
symbolic of Ninurta because of its light transparent

because gypsum, lime and pitch are smeared on the door of the house and the god of
light (Ninurta) tramples upon the demon of darkness.514.Two inferior deities
related to Nergal, god of the lower world. Their images placed at the

ibid. 166,12. He binds the evil ones, IV R. 21* C III 26.
The two are placed at the right and left of
a door to forbid the devils to enter. Maklu VI 124.515.The great trinity:
heaven, earth and sea.516.In any case a cult utensil on
which a noise was made, CT. 16, 24, 32.517.See the Chicago Syllabar 230 where she is identified with
Nidaba.518.Cf. ZA.
16, 178, 27; BA. V 649, 3; Shurpu VIII 10.519.So A. B. Cook,
Zeus, 632. I would, however, entertain doubts concerning this
explanation of silver as the emblem of the Asiatic Zeus and of Jupiter Dolichenus. The
identification of this metal with the sky god in Babylonia and Kommagene surely reposes
upon a more subtle idea.
[For the explanation of silver = Anu and gold = Enlil, see p. 342.]520.The Sabeans,
a pagan Aramaic sect of Mesopotamia at Harran, are said to have assigned
a metal to each planet. Since a considerable part of their religion was derived from
Babylonia we may consider this direct evidence for the Babylonian origin of the entire
tradition. For an account of the metals assigned to the planets by the Babylonians,
Persians, Greeks and Sabeans, see Bousset in Archiv fÃ¼r
Religionswissenschaft 1901, article on âDie Himmelreise der Seele.â
The order of the planets, taken from the Byzantine list above, is based upon their
relative distances from the sun.521.Restoration from Zim. Rt. 27.522.Conjectural restoration from ASKT.
96, 21. Zimmern, Rt. 27 I 3-4 has a longer description
of [Niná¸«abursildu a-á¸«a-lat [d
A-gub-ba bÃªlit] mÃª(?) Å¡a nÃ¢ri(?).523.This deity appears in incantations as the
queen of the holy waters bÃªlit egubbÃª, IV R. 28*b 16;
Bab. III 28, Sm. 491, 3. Although placed in the
court of Enlil the earth god as sister of Enlil
by the theologians, CT. 24, 11, 40 = 24, 52, where
she is associated with a special deity of holy
water, dA-gub-ba,
yet by function and character she belongs to the water cult of Eridu. Her
symbol is the holy water jar (duk) agubba
and the deity dAgubba is
Å¡u-luÄ£ lÄg-lÄg-ga Erida-ge,
Purifying handwasher of Eridu, CT. 24, 11, 41 = 24, 53. The river goddess
dIÄ is also
bÃªlit
agubbÃª, CT. 16, 7, 255 where in l. 254 Niná¸«abursildu
is aá¸«at dA-[gub-ba],
sister of Agubba, and the
river goddess is mother of Enki, or Ea, god of the sea,
CT. 24, 1, 25. The reading á¸«abur for
A-á¸ªA is most probable, and the cognate or dialectic
form á¸«ubur is a name for the mysterious sea
that surrounds the world. See BL. 115 n. 2. The holy water over which
she presides is taken
from the apsu or nether sea, which
issues from springs, hence egubbÃ» is spring water, CT. 17, 5
III 1. The name, then, really means âQueen of the lower
world river, she that walks (du) the
streets (sil).â The Semitic scribe
of CT. 25, 49, 6 renders the name in a loose way by bÃªlit tÃªlilti
bÃªlit Älikat sulÃª [rapÅ¡Äti], Queen of lustration, queen
that walks the [wide] streets (of the lower
world). For the title bÃªlit tÃªliltÄ«, see
CT. 26, 42 I 14. For a parallel to the description of her
walking the streets of inferno, cf.
d Kal-Å¡Ã¡g-ga sil-dagal-la
edin-na, Lady of purity who (walks) the
wide streets of the plain (of inferno), consort of Irragal,
god of the lower world, SBP. 158, 59. A
variant, KL. 16 III 8 has sil-gig-edin-na,
the dark street, etc.524.Variant of kÃ¢n-tÅ«r, V Raw. 42, 39.525.In K. 165 Rev. 8 f. the tamarisk
and date palm are said to be created in heaven (giÅ¡ an-na
Ã¹-tÅ­) and the same is said of them in Gudea, Cyl. B 4, 10,
giÅ¡-Å¡inig giÅ¡-Å¡eá¸³á¸³a (i. e. = Å¡ig =
giÅ¡immaru) an Ã¹-tud-da. This plant appears frequently
in magic rituals, IV R. 59b 4
iá¹£u bi-ni (Semitic), IV R.
16b 31, Shurpu IX 1-8, and also
in medical texts. bÃ®nu has been
identified with Syriac bÃ®nÄ,
tamarisk. If this identification be correct, a comparison with
the Hebrew legend of the manna
(bread of heaven in Psalms 105,40), said to have been
the exudation of the tamarisk, is possible.526.Semitic uá¸³uru, Aramaic
á¸³ÃªrÄ, see Meissner, MVAG. 1913, 2 p.
40 and BE. 31, 69 n. 2. Used both in medicine and magic.527.Passim in rituals and medicine. See BE. 31, 69, 27;
72, 29; King, Magic 11, 44;
Meissner, SAI. 2805.528.In Shurpu VIII 70 mentioned with
Å¡alÄlu. A magic ointment made of the
El and maÅ¡takal,
CT. 34, 9, 41. See also Ebeling, KTA. 90 rev. 17;
King, Magic 30, 25. Perhaps identical in
name with the stone arzallu, SAI. 8545. On a Dublin
tablet often giÅ¡ EL. Cf. Ãº-Å¡ig-el-Å¡ar =
Å¡Ã»mu, onion.529.For the correct
reading ni-nÃ¡-a, see AJSL. XXXIII 194, 159.530.Here a wood employed in magic,
cf. BE. 31, 60, 6+15. In syllabars giÅ¡-BUR = giÅ¡burru,
giÅ¡kirru, indicates a weapon or an utensil.531.NITA-DU, fire god, title of Nergal as fire god and identical
with d gÄ­r =
Nergal.532.Here
certainly Anu, heaven god, followed by Earth and Sea gods. Note
also dGu-la in
liturgies passim as title of Anu,
BL. 136. Anu = Sin, see p. 342.533.Title
of Enlil, lord of the totality of decrees. Enlil = Å amaÅ¡.534.Originally title of the great unmarried mother
goddess bÃªlit ilÄni, but often a title of the
virgin types Innini and NinÃ¢, BL. 141; of Gula
ibid. Also somewhat frequently she is Damkina,
consort of Ea, IV R. 54b 47;
CT. 33, 3, 21 her star beside that of Ea. Here she is the mother
goddess and the same order, Heaven, Earth, Sea, Mother Goddess
in Shurpu IV 42, where
Nin-maÄ£ has the Var. Nin-tud, Ebeling,
KTA. p. 121, 11. Symbols of these four deities on
boundary stones in same register, Hinke,
A New Boundary Stone, p. 28 second register, et passim.535.Possibly a metal stood here, identified with
dMAÅ ,
a star in Orion (Kaksidi= Beteigeuze),
CT. 33, 2, 6; King,
Magic 50, 29.536.Possibly the constellation
Ursa Major. Margidda, the Wagon is intended, identified with
Ninlil on a Berlin text, Weidner,
Handbuch 79, 10. See also Bezold
in Deimel, Pantheon
Babylonicum 215.537.From the
context certainly a title of Marduk. Zim. 27 I 19
omits LU-TU.538.Or
BÃªl-á¹£arbe, title of Nergal, v. VAB. IV 170,
67. Between lines 17 and 18 the variant
inserts two lines.539.But Mars in Amos 5, 26. I
accept here the later identifications, Nergal-Mars, Ninurta-Saturn.
The identifications in the earlier period of Babylonian astronomy appear to have been
Ninurta-Mars and Nergal-Saturn.540.Probably the astronomical form of Nusku as
god of the new moon, IV R. 23a 4. His character
as fire god is symbolized by the torch, ZA. VI 242, 24.
In II 10 supply Gibil after Zimmern
RT. 27, 5. As fire god he is messenger of Enlil.541.Papsukal, messenger of Zamama, god of KiÅ¡, a
form of Ninurta. He also like Nusku
derives his messenger character from his connection with
light, Papsukal Å¡a Å¡e-ir-ti, Papsukal of
the morning light, CT. 24, 40, 53. Since Ninurta is identified with Alpha of Orion,
Pap-sukal is
identified with one of the stars in Orion, CT.
33, 2 II 2; mulsib-zi-an-na
dPap-sukal
[sukal dAnim
IÅ¡tar] restored from Virolleaud,
Supplement LXVII 10. Here he is messenger of heaven and of
Ishtar as Venus, queen of heaven, that is, he is a messenger of the powers of celestial
light. Nusku and Pap-sukal often occur together in magic texts,
Shurpu VIII 10.542.Here probably
Sakkut as lord of light and justice, god of Isin, in his normal capacity.
See BL. 120 n. 6. His emblem is something made of date
palm, Å¡Ã¡g, giÅ¡immar. This deity is
unknown in magic texts except in Zimmern, Rt. 70,
8.543.Ishtar of Erech is Venus as
evening star, the effeminate Venus of Erech, see Tammuz
and Ishtar, 54 and 180 n. 4.544.Venus as morning star. The
Ishtar of Agade was the type of war goddess, see op. cit. p. 100;
hence Venus as morning star is sometimes called the Bow Star,
Kugler, Sternkunde II 198.545.Western title of GeÅ¡tinanna,
sister of Ishtar. Here perhaps the constellation Virgo.546.The seven gods
are the Pleiades, CT. 33, 2, 44. Since they are followed by Enmesharra
perhaps here to be identified with the seven sons
of Enmesharra (see BE. 31, 35). In ZA. VI 242,
20 gi-uru-gal-meÅ¡, âthe great reed spearsâ
are symbols of the seven great gods, sons of IÅ¡hara.
But traces of the last sign are not those of MEÅ 
here.547.In astronomy a form of Nin-urta =
Saturn, but by character allied to Nergal a lower world
deity. See line 11 above. For E. as Saturn note V Raw.
46a 21, his star UDU-LIM and II R.
48, 52 the same star is
dUDU-BAD-sag-uÅ¡ =
kaimÃ¢nu, Saturn. See also BE. 31, 35 n. 4 line 12,
kaimÄnu title of Enmesharra.548.Å¡imeÅ¡Å¡alÃ»

this deity is not legible in Zimmern's variant
and the first sign of the name
on the Nippur text is doubtful but apparently the Å¡eÅ¡Å¡ig
and gunu of Galu, that is REC. 100 later
RAB+GAN, (v. SAI. p. 155 note 1). After this sign
Zimmern and I have seen a sign
KU or Å U.
Labartu is usually written
RAB+GAN-ME. Here we may have to do with some new ideogram
for this deity. She is the daughter of Anu,
Haupt, ASKT. 94, 59. A prayer to the daughter of
Anu is King, Magic No. 61, 5-21.553.Zim.

              can do with most Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works even without complying with the
              full terms of this agreement. See paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can

              agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic
              works. See paragraph 1.E below.1.C.The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (âthe Foundationâ or PGLAF), owns a compilation
              copyright in the collection of Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works. Nearly all the
              individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the
              United States. If an individual work is in the public domain in the
              United States and you are located in the United States, we do not claim
              a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
              displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all
              references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope that you will support
              the Project Gutenbergâ¢ mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
              freely sharing Project Gutenbergâ¢ works in compliance with the terms of this
              agreement for keeping the Project Gutenbergâ¢ name associated with the work. You can
              easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in
              the same format with its attached full Project Gutenbergâ¢ License when you share it
              without charge with others.1.D.The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
              what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are in
              a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States, check
              the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
              before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
              creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project Gutenbergâ¢ work.

                do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread public domain works
                in creating the Project Gutenbergâ¢ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenbergâ¢
                electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
                contain âDefects,â such as, but not limited to, incomplete,
                inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
                intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other

                DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.1.F.3.LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND â If you discover a defect in
                this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a
                refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written
                explanation to the person you received the work from. If you received
                the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with your
                written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with the
                defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
                refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
                providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
                receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy
                is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
                opportunities to fix the problem.1.F.4.Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in

                the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any
                disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of
                the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
                interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
                the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
                provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.1.F.6.INDEMNITY â You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
                trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
                providing copies of Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works in accordance with this
                agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production, promotion
                and distribution of Project Gutenbergâ¢ electronic works, harmless from all
                liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees, that arise directly
                or indirectly from any of the following which you do or cause to occur:
                (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenbergâ¢ work, (b) alteration,
                modification, or additions or deletions to any Project Gutenbergâ¢ work, and (c) any
                Defect you cause.Section  2.Information about the Mission of Project Gutenbergâ¢Project Gutenbergâ¢ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works
            in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including
            obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the
            efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks
            of life.Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
            assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenbergâ¢'s goals and
            ensuring that the Project Gutenbergâ¢ collection will remain freely available for
            generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a
            secure and permanent future for Project Gutenbergâ¢ and future generations. To learn
            more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

            support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number
            of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in
            machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
            including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
            particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the
            IRS.The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
            charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
            States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
            we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
            DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
            visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donateWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
            have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
            against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
            approach us with offers to donate.International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
            any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
            outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and
            addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including
            checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please

            works.Professor Michael S. Hart is the
            originator of the Project Gutenbergâ¢ concept of a library of electronic works that
            could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and
            distributed Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer
            support.Project Gutenbergâ¢ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of
            which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
            notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in
            compliance with any particular paper edition.Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
            eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
            compressed (zipped), HTML and others.Corrected editions of our eBooks replace the old file
            and take over the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file
            is renamed. Versions based on separate sources are treated
            as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
